This website supplements the publication "Playing with Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the Japanese, Korean and Chinese YouTube Space", published in  Handbook of Japanese Games (ed. Rachael Hutchinson, MHM Limited 2025), with full-color figures, tables, and interactive network visualizations. They are presented in the order of appearance in the chapter.
In order to explore the data directly, please visit the GitHub repository. This research was funded by the JSPS in the context of the project “Exploratory Research on Play and Communities on Video Streaming Platforms” (22K18155).

Chapter summary:
Videogame play extends beyond the game world. It takes place in digital spaces such as wikis, blogs, or video streaming and sharing platforms. Being more than mere “paratexts,” these spaces are playgrounds in their own right. Players and users appropriate these spaces to negotiate and constitute videogame culture. This chapter asks how the widely popular game Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo 2020) in particular is played on the video sharing platform YouTube, focusing on the Japanese, Korean and Chinese language spaces. Examining the 100 most popular videos about the game on YouTube in each language space, I first identify several differences between them in terms of content preferences. In a second step, I apply a network analysis to the user comments on these videos to show how YouTube both strengthens lingual, national and game cultural boundaries, and serves to open up a transnational space for playing with Animal Crossing.
